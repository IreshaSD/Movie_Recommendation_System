# Movie Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity

## Description
This system implements a Movie Recommendation System that utilizes cosine similarity to suggest movies similar to a user's preferences. It works by extracting text-based features like genres, keywords, overviews, taglines, cast, and directors from a dataset and computes similarity scores between movies.

## Overview
The system executes the following steps:
- Loads movie data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame, handling potential parsing errors.
- Cleans the data, replaces null values with empty strings, and combines relevant features for recommendation.
- Converts the text data into feature vectors using TF-IDF Vectorization.
- Computes cosine similarity scores between movies based on their feature vectors.
- Prompts users to input their favorite movie to generate movie recommendations.
- Finds close matches for the user input in the movie dataset.
- Displays the top 30 suggested movies based on their similarity scores.


## Usage
1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries:
     - `numpy`
     - `pandas`
     - `scikit-learn`

2. **Execution:**
   - Load the code in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code).
   - Run the code and input your favorite movie when prompted.

## Note
- Specify the correct path to the CSV file containing movie data in the code.
- The recommendations may vary based on the dataset and similarity calculations.
